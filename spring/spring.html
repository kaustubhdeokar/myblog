<h1>Spring Framework</h1>
<p>
    Based on two key principles dependency injection and inversion of control.
    The meaning of which is you have to specify the object spring has to create via annotations, 
    and spring will create it for you and inject in your program. 
    
    Hence this responsibility for populating the dependency is referred to as IOC.

    <div>
        <h2>Beans</h2>
        Class managed by spring.<br>
        Annotation -> @Component
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>Autowiring</h2>
        The process of identifying a match, and injecting it is autowiring.
        If more than one bean of the same type is availble -> error thrown. <br>
        Annotation -> @Autowired
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>Dependency Injection</h2>
        Looking out for appropriate classes(bean) and injecting them as a dependency.<br>
        It performs dependency injection using a setter or a contructor.
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>Inversion of control</h2>
        The responsibility of making dependency injection happen for all components/beans is IOC.<br>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h2>IOC Container</h2>
        Framework which provides IOC functionality. Spring provides two implementations,<br>
        application context and bean factory. Application context is recommended unless a memory concern.
    </div>

<p class="modules">
    <div>
        <h2>Core Container</h2>
        <p>
            Contains core, bean, context and expression language.
            Fundamental functionality ioc, dependency injection, internationalization. 
        </p>

        <h2>Data access / integration </h2>
        <p>
            JDBC - db connectivity <br>
            ORM - integration with ORM frameworks, hibernate, jpa <br>
            JMS - module talks to other applications through queue, to produce and consume messages.<br>
            Transaction module - successful rollback in case of failure.<br>

    <p>Spring boot - is used to develop micro services.</p>

    <p>
        Spring Cloud allows the development of cloud native applications that can be dynamically configured and deployed.
        It provides functionality for handling common patterns in distributed systems.
    </p>


    <p>
        Spring Data provides consistent access to SQL and NoSQL databases.
    </p>

    <p>
        Spring Integration implements the patterns outlined by the book Enterprise Application Integration Patterns.
        It allows enterprise applications to be connected easily through messaging and declarative adapters.
    </p>

    <p>
        Spring Batch provides functionality to handle large volumes of data like ability to restart, ability to read from and write to different systems, chunk processing, parallel processing, and transaction management.
    </p>

    <p>
        Spring Security provides security solutions for different applications be it a web application or a REST service. It also provides authentication and authorization features.
    </p>

    <p>
        Spring Session manages session information and makes it easier to share session data between services in the cloud regardless of the platform/container. It also supports multiple sessions in a single browser instance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Spring Mobile offers device detection and progressive rendering options that make mobile web application development easy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Spring Android facilitates the development of Android applications.
    </p>

@SpringBootApplication 
is in built configured with three annotations

@Configuration 
@EnableAutoConfiguration 
@ComponentScan - scans components in it's package and subpackage.
