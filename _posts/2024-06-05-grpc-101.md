### Background

#### Need for grpc ?

- SOAP, REST or GraphQL do not solve the problem of bidirectional communication.
- Any communication protocol needs client library to work. (When communication is done through the web, web browser is the client library)
- If the user uses any client library, it has to be maintained, which is not ideal.
- ![]({{page.image | relative_url}})

#### Why to use it ?
- High performance - HTTP/2.
- gRPC uses Protocol Buffers for compact and fast serialization, ensuring efficient data exchange.
- Good support for various programming languages. 
- gRPC simplifies implementing secure and scalable microservices. With built-in support for authentication, load balancing, and service discovery,
- Lastly, its rich ecosystem and active community provide extensive resources, tools, and ongoing improvements.

### Implementation theory

How to implement 
you start with a proto file. 

each language has library/plugin support to generate classes based on the proto file.
These classes are known as stubs.

Server side implements a service class which contains the actual business logic.
Client side - writes a client to invoke methods on server based upon it's local stub.

client and server communicate with each other through http 2.
