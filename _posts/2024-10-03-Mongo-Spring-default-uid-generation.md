why is it so difficult to create a id generator for mongo db via spring ?

Creating an ID generator for MongoDB via Spring can be challenging due to a few inherent complexities:

MongoDB's Default ID Generation: MongoDB already provides a default mechanism for generating unique IDs using the ObjectId type. These IDs are 12-byte hexadecimal values, ensuring uniqueness across collections. If you're trying to override or customize this behavior, it adds complexity since MongoDB isn't designed to rely on sequential or user-defined IDs by default.

Lack of Atomic Increment: In relational databases, it's common to use auto-incrementing fields for IDs. MongoDB does not natively support this feature. To simulate auto-incrementing IDs, developers must create a custom sequence collection or counter, which involves using a separate document to track the current sequence number and update it atomically. This introduces additional overhead in ensuring consistency and atomicity when multiple instances of your service are running.

Concurrency and Performance: Handling concurrent requests for ID generation in a distributed environment is another challenge. Using a sequence collection requires careful locking or atomic updates (such as findAndModify) to prevent race conditions, which can reduce performance and scalability. When scaling the application, ensuring the atomic update mechanism doesn’t become a bottleneck adds further complexity.

Distributed Systems: If your application is distributed across multiple servers, ensuring that IDs are unique without collision across instances becomes more challenging. Solutions like UUIDs are often used in distributed systems to avoid this problem, but custom ID generation mechanisms like sequential IDs need careful handling of state synchronization across nodes.

Custom Solutions: Implementing your own ID generator requires careful handling of error cases (e.g., retries, handling failures in incrementing the sequence, etc.) and involves extra logic. The typical pattern of a sequence document is often unfamiliar to those coming from relational database backgrounds.

To implement a custom ID generator in Spring for MongoDB, you would typically use a collection to store sequence counters, and for each insert, increment the counter atomically. You can use MongoOperations with a method like findAndModify to safely update and return the next sequence number.

Here’s a basic approach for implementing a custom sequence generator:

java
Copy code
public class SequenceGeneratorService {

    @Autowired
    private MongoOperations mongoOperations;

    public long generateSequence(String seqName) {
        DatabaseSequence counter = mongoOperations.findAndModify(
            Query.query(Criteria.where("_id").is(seqName)),
            new Update().inc("seq", 1),
            FindAndModifyOptions.options().returnNew(true).upsert(true),
            DatabaseSequence.class);
        return !Objects.isNull(counter) ? counter.getSeq() : 1;
    }
}
In this example:

The DatabaseSequence document tracks the sequence for a given collection.
findAndModify is used to increment and retrieve the current sequence in one atomic operation.
In conclusion, the difficulty mainly stems from MongoDB's nature of not having native support for sequential IDs, concurrency concerns, and the need for atomic updates to maintain consistency.

mongo db and springs default id generation technique

In Spring Data MongoDB, when working with MongoDB, the framework provides a built-in mechanism for generating unique identifiers for documents, typically using the ObjectId class. Here’s how it works:

1. Default ID Generation Using ObjectId:
By default, if no ID is specified when saving a document, MongoDB automatically generates a 12-byte ObjectId for the _id field. This object includes information such as the timestamp, machine identifier, process identifier, and an incrementing counter, which ensures global uniqueness.
In Spring Data MongoDB, if you annotate an entity's ID field with @Id, the framework automatically uses MongoDB's default ObjectId generation strategy if no custom value is provided.
Example:
java
Copy code
@Document(collection = "myCollection")
public class MyEntity {
    @Id
    private String id;  // MongoDB will auto-generate an ObjectId
    
    private String name;
}
In this case, MongoDB will generate an ObjectId for id unless a value is provided explicitly.
2. Custom ID Generation:
Spring allows for custom ID generation strategies if you don't want to use ObjectId. You can implement your own sequence-based generator or use a UUID, depending on your use case.

UUID as ID: You can replace the default ObjectId with a UUID by manually setting it in your application code.
java
Copy code
@Document(collection = "myCollection")
public class MyEntity {
    @Id
    private String id = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    
    private String name;
}
Custom Sequence Generator: As mentioned before, you can also create a sequence generator to generate sequential IDs if needed. This requires maintaining a separate collection that tracks sequence numbers.
Why Use ObjectId?
Uniqueness: The ObjectId is guaranteed to be unique across collections, processes, and even different machines, making it ideal for distributed systems.
Timestamp Information: The ObjectId contains a timestamp, which allows sorting documents by creation time without needing an explicit timestamp field.
Compactness: The 12-byte size of ObjectId is compact and offers better space efficiency compared to using other types like UUID (which are 16 bytes).
In summary, MongoDB's default ID generation using ObjectId is typically sufficient for most use cases, and Spring Data MongoDB embraces this by automatically using ObjectId for the _id field unless otherwise specified. If a custom ID strategy is needed, you can implement one using UUIDs or custom sequences.


My code sample:

Comment class.
```
public class Comment {
    @org.springframework.data.annotation.Transient
    public static final String ID_VAL = "sequence_generator";
    @org.springframework.data.annotation.Transient
    public static final String GENERATED_ID = "commentId";
    @org.springframework.data.annotation.Transient
    public static final String ID_KEY = "id";
```

Generate comment id: 
```
public Long generateCommentId() {
    return idGeneratorService.getCommentsId(Comment.ID_KEY, Comment.ID_VAL, Comment.GENERATED_ID);
}
```

fetch comment id from db:
```
    public Long getCommentsId(String collectionId, String collectionIdVal, String generatedIdValue) {

        Query query = new Query(Criteria.where(collectionId).is(collectionIdVal));
        //update the sequence no
        Update update = new Update().inc(generatedIdValue, 1);
        //modify in document

        IdSequence counter = mongoOperations
                .findAndModify(query,
                        update, options().returnNew(true).upsert(true),
                        IdSequence.class);

        return Objects.isNull(counter) ? 1 : counter.getCommentId();
    }
```
