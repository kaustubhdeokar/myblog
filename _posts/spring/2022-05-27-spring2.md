> Spring MVC and Spring Boot are components of spring framework. Spring offers features that are easy to integrate with other frameworks.

### Spring MVC
    is a http oriented spring framework, concerned with developing web applications. 
    dispatcher servlet is the front controller, handles all the request
    view resolver view names to physical views.
    there is a decoupling of all these different things. 

### Spring boot
    It internally uses spring mvc, it solves the auto configuration part for us. 
    There is no need to clarify the dispatcher servlet, view resolver and transaction manager and stuff.
